# Portfolio Assignment 1 â€“ HTML5 & CSS3  

This is my first portfolio project for **INFR 3120 â€“ Web and Script Programming** at Ontario Tech University.  
The purpose of this assignment was to create a responsive HTML5/CSS3 portfolio using techniques taught in **Weeks 1â€“4** of the course.

## Viewport Sizes  
For responsive design, I created three separate stylesheets:  
- **Mobile (â‰¤ 640px)** â€“ wrapper width set to 95%, single-column layout, larger tap-friendly nav buttons.  
- **Tablet (641px â€“ 1024px)** â€“ wrapper width set to 90%, two-column layout for projects, nav links inline.  
- **Desktop (â‰¥ 1025px)** â€“ wrapper fixed at 960px, multi-column layout, more space for featured elements.  

I chose these breakpoints because they match common device widths and were the ones demonstrated in class.

## Gradients  
I used linear gradients to improve the look of the site:  
- **Body background** â€“ diagonal gradient (135Â°) from deep purple â†’ violet â†’ pink.  
- **Header/banner** â€“ horizontal gradient (90Â°) from violet â†’ pink for contrast.  
- **Wrapper** â€“ gradient (160Â°) from darker purple â†’ bright violet â†’ soft pink for depth.  
- **Projects** â€“ angled gradient (120Â°) with semi-transparent purple/pink for card styling.  
- **Footer** â€“ vertical gradient (180Â°) from dark purple â†’ violet.  

Angles and gradient use were based on **Week 3 lectures** (CSS3 backgrounds and gradients).

## Color Scheme  
I chose a **purple-pink color palette** (violet, magenta, pink, and dark plum tones).  
- This scheme is professional but still creative, fitting my personal style.  
- Colors were tested with white text for good contrast and accessibility.  
- Adobe Color inspired the palette, but I customized it to fit my site.

## Course Material (Weeks 1â€“4)  

I built this assignment entirely using code and concepts from the course:  

- **Week 1**:  
  - UTF-8 charset declaration.  
  - Resetting margins/padding (`html, body { margin:0; padding:0; }`).  
  - Basic HTML5 structure with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.  

- **Week 2**:  
  - Semantic tags (`header`, `footer`, `nav`, `article`, `section`).  
  - Borders, padding, margins for layout.  
  - Text styling (`font-family`, colors, link styling).  
  - Lists and navigation menu (`ul`, `li`, `a`).  

- **Week 3**:  
  - Linear gradients for backgrounds.  
  - RGBA for semi-transparent colors.  
  - Border-radius for rounded corners.  
  - Opacity for subtle effects.  

- **Week 4**:  
  - Pseudo-classes (`:hover`) on links and buttons.  
  - CSS transitions for smooth hover effects.  
  - CSS transforms (`scale`, `rotate`) on boxes and images.

## Testing and Validation

All HTML pages and CSS stylesheets were validated using the W3C HTML and CSS validators, with no major errors. Links were checked with the W3C Link Checker, spelling was reviewed, and accessibility was tested with the WAVE tool.

## Features of the Portfolio  
- **Home Page** â€“ navigation bar and featured boxes.  
- **About Page** â€“ headshot image and introduction video.  
- **Projects Page** â€“ thumbnails with descriptions of sample projects.  
- **Contact Page** â€“ form with name, email, phone, and comments.
